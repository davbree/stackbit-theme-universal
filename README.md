### Stackbit Themes

Use this theme with [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com) to create a website powered by any combination of static site generator and headless CMS.

### Pick your Static Site Generator

This theme is built using [Unibit](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit) which is a superset of popular static site generators. Stackbit can transpile this theme into a Jekyll, Hugo or Gatsby site (more generators coming soon).

### Pick your Headless CMS

The included [stackbit.yaml](https://docs.stackbit.com/content-model/stackbit-yml/) file defines a universal content model for your content, front matter and data. Stackbit can automatically connect this theme to CMS like Contentful, DatoCMS, Forestry, Netlify CMS, etc.
